So many things involved that make you delay activities:
	Fear of failure/success: avoid bad feelings, rising expectations
	Perfectionism: waiting forever, paralysis
	Dopamine: prefer instant reward instead of delayed growth
	Ego: subconciously avoid certain activities
	Paradox of choices: paralysis in overwhelming options
	Not having a clear goal and plan

How to tackle:
	Identify the cause
		Do a minimal action
			Consistency > Spontaneity
