A psychological signal. Very hard to trace the origin.
	Noise: thoughts, fatigue, overthinking
	Past experience: failures, feedback
	Lack of data: fear, uncertainty
	Perfectionism: no space for mistakes
	Comparison: you don't know what they've been through
	Expectation: things take time

To deal with it:
	It's a signal.
	Do we have data?
		No -> discard and move on
		Yes: e.g., repeated past failures
			Identify the cause.
				Change where things went wrong.
					Try again.

In short:
	Stop and ask yourself.
	Change approach if needed.
	Make small changes.
