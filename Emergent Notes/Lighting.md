- Incandescent light: heating till glowing (Tungsten - Wolfram), insufficient, short lifespan
- Gas discharge light: electric current excites gas atoms
	- Fluorescent: mercury vapor and phosphor
	- Neon: colors from ionized gas
- [[Solid-state lighting]]
- Laser light: radiation stimulated emission
