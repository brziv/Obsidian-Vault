#theory 

Uses qubits instead of bits (0, 1)
	Superposition: a qubit can be a combination of 0 and 1
	Entanglement: qubits can have correlated states
	Interference: amplitudes can cancel or reinforce, like waves

Exponential state space: 2^n states for an n-qubit system

Advantages:
	Factoring: Shor's algorithm
	Search: Grover's algorithm
	Quantum simulation: molecules, physical systems

For now, it holds potential, but the tricky part is reading the output.
	We only get probabilistic results, because measurement collapses the state.
		Algorithms are designed to manipulate amplitudes for the answer to show up.
