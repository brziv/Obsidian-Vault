#theory 

Studies the resources required to solve computational problems using algorithms.
	Time complexity: Big O notation
		P: can solve in polynomial time (easy to solve)
		NP: can verify in polynomial time (easy to check)
		NP-complete: hardest verifiable problems (in NP)
		NP-hard: at least as hard as NP-complete; not necessarily verifiable or decidable
		EXP: can solve in exponential time (very slow)
	Space complexity: memory used
