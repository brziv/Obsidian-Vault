I got to use this platform pretty early, and if I recall correctly, I have been using it for more than 10 years, starting from early days in primary school. At first, it was used by me to listen to music, watch entertaining videos for children.

Over time, the way I use it, and especially, the number and diversity of the contents change. The so-called "legends" have retired, or changed the content they produce, and the target audience they aim at.

Now, it is the place for me to learn from the most brilliant, or the more suitable word, helpful, people I can get access to. Some to mention: Veritasium, 3Blue1Brown, Computerphile, and more in other fields, including math, physics, computer science, and potentially finance.

Not only that, it is also an amazing place to relax my mind listening to calm and charming voice from girls all around the world, listening to music, watching people play games, and other types of content that are so vast to mention.
