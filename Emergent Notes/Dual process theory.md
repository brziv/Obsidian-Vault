All human thoughts come from 2 distinct cognitive systems:
	System 1: fast, intuitive, automatic (Intuition)
		Experiences, biases -> rapid decisions
	System 2: slow, analytical, deliberate (Consciousness)
		Reasoning, attention -> careful analysis

So, it's natural to be slow at first, because System 2 is working, and you're learning.
	Once things are settled, System 1 makes the process autonomous.
