	"Try to achieve something in a period of time" - Me

In a project, we have several related items:
	Charter: formally authorize
	Closure report: formally end
	Triple constraint: scope, time, cost
	Product breakdown: from general to details
	Network diagram: flow, dependencies
		Float: time can be delayed between tasks
	Change control: manage changes
		Documentation: for others, future reference
		Gold plating: unnecessary requirements
		`request -> impact -> decide -> update -> notify -> actions`
