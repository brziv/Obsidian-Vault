#management

According to the PMI, a project is defined as a temporary endeavor to create a unique product or result. In other words, it is an attempt with a defined beginning and end, and with a goal in mind.
	"Try to achieve something in a period of time" - Me

In a project, we have several related items:
	Charter: formally authorize
	Closure report: formally end
	Triple constraint: [[Scope]], [[Time (project)]], [[Cost (project)]]
	Product breakdown: from general to details
	Change control: manage changes
		Documentation: for others, future reference
		Gold plating: unnecessary requirements
		`request -> impact -> decide -> update -> notify -> actions`
	Life cycle
		`Initiation`: identify sponsor, scope, stakeholders, PM. Project charter (sponsor) is required to move on.
		`Planning`: scope statement, WBS, schedule, management of all related elements.
		`Execution`: team, procurement (buying), communication with stakeholders
		`Monitoring & Control`: progress, adjustments based on objectives and milestones, reduce risks, ensure project is done with the budget
		`Closing`: hand off deliverables, release team members and resources, analyze performance
