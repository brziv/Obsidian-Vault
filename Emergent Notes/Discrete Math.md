#theory 

Study structures that are countable or distinct $\neq$ continuous (Calculus)
-> Foundation for computer science

Built on: First-order logic, ZFC set theory, Peano axioms, Turing machine
	Logic:
		Proposition (`statement`), connective (`AND, OR, NOT`), quantifier (`∀, ∃`)
		Truth table
		-> proof, circuit, programming
	Set theory: collection of objects and operations
		Union (`∪`), intersection(`∩`), difference (`\`), complement (`¬`)
		Cardinality, power set, Cartesian product
		-> database
	Relation and function:
		Reflexive, symmetric, transitive
		Injective, surjective, bijective
		-> database, algorithm
	Counting and combinatorics:
		Permutation, combination, pigeonhole principle
		-> probability, cryptography, algorithm
	Graph and tree:
		Node, edge, directed, undirected, degree, tree, binary tree
		-> network, data structure
	Number theory:
		GCD, LCM, prime number, modular arithmetic
		-> cryptography, hashing
	Algorithm and complexity:
		Big-O, Big-Ω, Big-Θ, recurrence relation
		-> optimization
