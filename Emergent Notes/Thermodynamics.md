Studies how energy and heat behave in physical systems.
	How objects move, spread, transform -> explain our world

Zeroth law:
	In temperature, if A = C, and B = C, then A = B
		`=` means thermal equilibrium, `A, B, C` are systems/objects 
	-> define, measure, and compare temperature
		System C (thermometer) compares A and B

First law:
	Energy can't be created or destroyed, only transformed
	-> conservation of energy

Second law:
	In any closed system, entropy tends to go up
		More states available for the disorder
		Order is rare, the extreme cases (statistics)
		-> Time flows, energy spreads

Third law:
	Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature
	-> you can never reach absolute zero
