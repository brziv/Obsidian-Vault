#theory

Data: raw observations (numbers, letters, signals)

Information: data that answers a question (meaningful context)
	Order: no surprise, no information
	Chaos: maximum information, hard to extract anything
	Meaningful information: complex patterns that we can work with
	-> brings meaning and purpose, more powerful than fleeting feelings

Knowledge: processed, understood information that can be connected to other information
-> patterns, abstraction (still in the realm of intuition)

Skill: ability to use, apply knowledge to create something
	Teaching, writing in your own words
	Adapting in various scenarios:
		Experience: repeated attempts
		Feedback: to learn, to change
