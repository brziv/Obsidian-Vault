Computer Science (CS)

Literally the foundation for everything related to computers you see nowadays and will see in the future.

This foundation is built upon several other critical foundations, especially Math and Physics.
	Math: Boolean algebra, first-order logic, set theory, information theory, complexity theory
	Computability: Turing machine, lambda calculus, Godel's incompleteness theorems
	Engineering & Physics: Digital electronics, semiconductor, Von Neumann architecture
	Lingustics: Chomsky hierarchy, automata theory
