#tool

A tool that I find fascinating just after minutes of exploring and seeing what it can offer. It can be a total game-changer for someone as introspective as me, who is a deep thinker seeking meaning, truth, better understanding of the world, including reality and human ourselves, emotionally and psychologically.

Some of its functions that make it so great as a tool:
	Backlinks: create bidirectional relationships, build hierarchies
	Graph view: see all the notes I have ever created, a knowledge graph
	Groups/Clusters: in graph view
	Canvas: sketch ideas with multiple elements
