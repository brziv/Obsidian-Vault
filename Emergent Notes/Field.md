A **field** $F$ is a set with two operations:

- $(F, +)$ is an abelian group
- $(F \setminus \{0\}, \cdot)$ is an abelian group
- Multiplication distributes over addition

In a field:
- Every nonzero element has a **multiplicative inverse**
- There are **no zero divisors**

---
### Key Properties

- Commutativity of both operations
- Multiplicative identity: $1 \ne 0$
- Division is well-defined (except by 0)

---
### Examples

- $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$: rational, real, complex numbers
- $\mathbb{F}_p = \mathbb{Z}_p$ for prime $p$ (finite field)
- $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$: finite field extensions

---
### Related Concepts

- **Field extension**: enlarging a field to contain solutions (e.g., $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$)
- **Characteristic**: smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n \cdot 1 = 0$ (or 0 if none)
- **Algebraic/Transcendental** elements over a base field
- **Galois theory**: studies field extensions via groups

---
### Why Fields Matter

- Division, solving equations, and vector spaces all depend on field structure
- Fields are the arithmetic core of algebra, geometry, number theory, and cryptography

---
### Summary

Fields combine two abelian groups (additive and multiplicative) into a structure where arithmetic behaves "perfectly." They are essential for linear algebra, Galois theory, and beyond.
