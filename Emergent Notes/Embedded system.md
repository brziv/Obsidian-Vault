Essentially a computer with a specialized processor (microcontroller - MCU), memory and I/O devices (sensors, actuators).
	Specific tasks, not general-purpose
	Often integrated as a part of a bigger system
	Constraints: real-time, resources

Based on functional requirements:
	Standalone: microwave oven, calculator
	Real-time (soft/hard): traffic, millitary, medicine
	Networked: security, ATM
	Mobile: phone, mp3 player

Based on MCU performance:
	Small-scale: 8-bit, 16-bit
	Medium-scale: 16-bit, 32-bit
	Sophisticated: 32-bit, 64-bit
