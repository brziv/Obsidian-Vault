-> compression -> approval -> Cost baseline

EAC (Estimate At Completion) = AC + (BAC - EV) / (CPI * SPI)
	BAC (Budget): planned budget when complete the 
	CPI (Cost Performance Index) = EV / AC -> budget (<1 ineffcient, =1 OK, >1 saving)
	SPI (Schedule) = EV / PV -> progress (slow, OK, fast)
		Planned value (PV)
		Earned value (EV): work completed with PV
		Actual cost (AC)
