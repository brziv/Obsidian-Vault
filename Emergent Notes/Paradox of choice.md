Having too many options to choose from actually lead to anxiety, depression and negative feelings instead of satisfaction and happiness.
	Decision paralysis: freeze, delay, no idea which to choose
	Oppoturnity cost + regret: basically FOMO thoughts
		You think there are better choices

To deal with it:
	Set "good enough" criteria
		Rank and choose immediately
		-> Be grateful and feel good about it
