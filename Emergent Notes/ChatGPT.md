#tool #artificial-intelligence 

A mind-blowing tool, and I don't remember now how I got to know and started using it, but it was in late 2023, when I just entered university not for so long.

Since then, the tool has been improved a lot by the developers, and it is still going on. There are more features now, and the model's performance gradually increases after updates.

After more than 1 year of using, I have quite enough experience to really harness its power while not being dependent on it. The secrets all lie in which questions to ask (prompt), and what to do when receiving the answers (process information, make actions).

To sum up, it is an awesome [[AI]] tool that accelerates the process of gathering and summarizing information. Its role is like an assistant, that is to say, anything it tells you is not always reliable, so you must keep a skeptical attitude in mind. Always question, recheck, and ask follow-up questions to both deepen your understanding while also verify the correctness of the statements.
