Measures uncertainty, disorder, randomness, possibilities

Information theory:
	How much we don't know before receiving a message
	-> that message increases our understanding, or reduces the uncertainty

Physical systems:
	How spread out things are
	From low to high entropy: tidy -> messy
	-> why time flows forward (along with what happens)
