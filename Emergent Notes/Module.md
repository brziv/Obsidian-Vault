#theory 

A **module** over a ring $R$ is like a **vector space**, but the scalars come from a **ring** (not necessarily a field).

Formally, an **$R$-module** is an abelian group $(M, +)$ with an operation $R \times M \to M$ (scalar multiplication) such that for all $r, s \in R$ and $x, y \in M$:

1. $r(x + y) = rx + ry$  
2. $(r + s)x = rx + sx$  
3. $(rs)x = r(sx)$  
4. $1x = x$ if $R$ has identity $1$

This is exactly a **vector space** if $R$ is a **field**.

### Examples

- $\mathbb{Z}$-module: any abelian group (e.g. $\mathbb{Z}$ acts by multiplication)
- $R^n$: module of $n$-tuples over a ring $R$
- $R[x]$: module over $R$
- $M_n(R)$: $n \times n$ matrices form an $R$-module
- Vector space = module over a field

---
### Types of Modules

- **Left module**: scalars act on the left ($rx$)
- **Right module**: scalars act on the right ($xr$)
- **Free module**: has a basis (like vector space)
- **Finitely generated**: generated by a finite set of elements
- **Cyclic module**: generated by one element

---
### Submodules and Homomorphisms

- A **submodule** is a subset closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
- A **module homomorphism** $f: M \to N$ preserves structure:
  - $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$
  - $f(rx) = rf(x)$

### Quotient Modules

- Given a submodule $N \subseteq M$, the **quotient module** $M/N$ consists of cosets $m + N$.
- This is analogous to quotient groups and quotient vector spaces.

### Exact Sequences and Structure Theory

- In module theory (especially over $\mathbb{Z}$ or PID), we use:
  - Exact sequences
  - Direct sums
  - Decomposition theorems
- Over a PID (e.g. $\mathbb{Z}$), finitely generated modules can be classified.

### Modules vs Vector Spaces

| Property             | Vector Space             | Module                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Scalars              | Field                    | Ring                            |
| Always has basis     | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ Not always                   |
| Division possible    | ✅                       | ❌ Not unless ring is a field   |
| Linear algebra tools | Apply fully              | Partially apply                 |

### Why Study Modules?

- Generalize vector spaces to arbitrary rings
- Foundation of **linear algebra over rings**
- Central in **homological algebra**, **representation theory**, and **algebraic geometry**
- Describe solutions to systems of equations over rings

### Summary

Modules are to **rings** what vector spaces are to **fields**: algebraic structures where scalars act on elements. They are a unifying concept across algebra, geometry, and topology.
