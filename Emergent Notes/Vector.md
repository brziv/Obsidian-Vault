#theory 

Physics: an arrow with magnitude (length) and direction ->
CS: a list of numbers `[num]`
Math: an element of the vector space

Coordinate system: 2D Cartesian (x, y)
`[x, y]` tells you how to move from tail to tip in parallel to `i` and `j`
`[+ -]` indicates upward and downward motion
Each pair maps to only one vector

Addition: overall certain movement (steps)
Multiplication: stretching, squishing, reversing -> "scaling" -> scalar

Basis: `i(1, 0)` and `j(0, 1)`
	The basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span that space.

Linear combination: $a \ \vec v + b \ \vec w$ 
	Span: set of all possible linear combinations (vectors), the smallest subspace containing them
	-> 2 vectors: plane, line or origin $\vec0$ 

Linearly dependent: $\vec u = a \ \vec v + b \ \vec w$ 
	This vector does not unlock new vectors with linear combinations
	It can be removed without reducing the span
