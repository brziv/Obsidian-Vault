Special case of beta distribution
	Beta: continuous probability distribution on [0, 1], parameters alpha and beta
		Special case of Dirichlet distribution
	PERT: beta but 3 parameters min, mode and max

Using this with Monte Carlo simulation gives us the estimations
	Monte Carlo: repeated random sampling to model probability of outcomes

Distribution tells the probability of each task
Simulation tells the probability of the whole system
