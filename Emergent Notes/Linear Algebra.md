#application 

Vector: arrow inside data space with position, direction
	List of numbers
	-> input, features, parameters (weights)

Dot product: cosine similarity shows alignment
	-> attention, activation, embeddings

Matrix: transformation of vector space
	Function that rotate, scale, project
	-> filters, layers in neural networks

Matrix multiplication: transformation chain
	Multiple transformations in a row
	-> pipeline, stacking

Linear system: Ax = b
	Linear function f(x) = wx + b
	-> regression by finding appropriate w and b

Transpose: switch perspectives
	Switch rows with columns
	-> look at space from a different view
