#ai

This term refers to any act that tries to give machines, or computers, the ability to do tasks that previously only human can do, which means giving them the "intelligence".

Intelligence, in this case, is the ability to acquire knowledge and use it to solve problems, perform tasks in order to achieve some kind of goals, usually aim to increase the efficiency of tasks, especially ones that are repetitive, clear (in steps), specific, doable by human. However, with the rate of development as of now, the definition is changing day by day, with some of the trends being Multimodal Model, AI Agent, Edge AI;  which is making AI closer to human in ability. However, there is still a long way to achieve AGI, with challenges (ethics, regulation) waiting to be resolved and benefits (productivity, education) being explored.
