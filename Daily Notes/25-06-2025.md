I learned painful lessons from recent IoT experiments.

I often get stuck in long, exhausting debugging sessions, even when I know I should stop.
	I start without a good plan
	I set no limits when debugging
	I am unable to stop even when tired, mentally fatigue

To address this problem:
	Plan a bit (goal, steps) while stay flexible: Cognitive rigidity
	Slow down, pause and evaluate: Perseveration, Sunk cost
	Tasks are tasks, not identity: Ego
	Formally end the session with notes: Rumination
