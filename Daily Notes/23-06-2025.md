#insight 

As planned before, at like midnight, now I start doing the work.
### Work

I look at [[Notion]], and I see that the first thing I am going to do is the university work.
	Firstly, I will take a look at the [[Project Management]] recap
	Then, I read the [[Information Security]] slides

### Insights

Knowing about something and knowing how to do it are 2 different things.
The real learning happens with struggles and mistakes.
We gain experience, skills, and with reflection, we reveals the patterns.
We will form the abstractions, which lead us to wisdom.
