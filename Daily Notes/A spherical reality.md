I imagine reality as a sphere. Not a normal one though. The core and the periphery are unknown.
	By going deep into the core, we can access the surface by moving outwards.
	There are many paths, but they'll eventually converge at the core. 
		Abstraction is the destination, not the starting point.
	We reach that by digging: from the smallest, most specific, most embodied acts.
		Toolset: think, explain, write, experiment
		Keyword: repetition, friction

Later, when mature enough, it's time for resonance, the echoes:
	Computer science -> math, physics, philosophy, psychology
	-> biology, economics
		Remember health, emotion, conversation, relationship.
