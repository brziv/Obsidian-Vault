In 1961, Edward Lorenz ran a weather model - a system of equations on a computer. He found that even with very slight changes in the initial conditions, the system diverged drastically.
	This changed our understanding since Newton, as the world is now seen as unpredictable, yet still shows some kinds of structure.

The world is a chaotic system, and there exists a prediction horizon, a length of time within which we can provide sufficiently reliable predictions. This makes things worth discovering.

Entropy measures disorder or uncertainty. Too much order is repetitive, no change, no surprise, no development; while too much disorder is noisy, random, no meaning, no useful information.
	This leaves meaning in somewhere between, emerges from complex patterns, where our systems (society, economics, culture) are formed.

That is to say, there may be no such thing as a universal truth. It might not exist, and even if it does, it may be too complex for human to comprehend. The best I think we can do is updating our neural pathways to engage more deeply with reality, and construct our own personal meaning.
	System 1 - a warrior, system 2 - a general, and I - an overseer. I am a system that proves itself.
