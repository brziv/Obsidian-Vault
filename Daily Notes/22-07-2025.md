## Math Foundation: Sets & Functions

**All of mathematics can be viewed through the lens of sets and functions.**

- Everything reduces to **sets** (ZFC foundation).
- **Functions** are structure-preserving mappings between sets.
- This simple perspective explains a vast amount of math intuitively and geometrically.

### ZFC Set Theory

- Zermelo–Fraenkel + Axiom of Choice.
- Everything (numbers, spaces, logic) can be encoded as sets.
- The *language of math*.

---
### Functions: The Bridge

- Functions are **morphisms**: they preserve or reflect structure.
- Most of mathematics is about **how sets relate** via functions.
	- Continuous functions
	- Linear maps

---
### Understanding Equations

- Equations describe **relations** → **sets of solutions**.
- Solving = finding **intersections** (e.g., hyperplanes).
- Example:  
  Linear system → intersection of planes → solution set = common points.

---
### Abstract ≠ Understanding

- Symbols can obscure if not grounded in concrete examples.
- **Concept before abstraction** leads to real understanding.
- Formalism comes **after** understanding—not before.
- Use **sets + functions** to "decode" abstraction.

## Where to Go Next

- **Category Theory**: morphisms between structures.
- **Topology**: sets + open sets (subsets of power set).
- **Manifolds**: sets locally like ℝⁿ, glued via functions.
- **Algebra**: groups, rings = sets + operations (functions).
- **Logic / Model Theory**: structure of truth over sets.
