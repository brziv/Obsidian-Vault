### 📚 Suggested Resources

#### For Mathematics

- 🇫🇷 *Livre CPGE/MP-MPI* (e.g., **Belin**, **H&K**, **SupMaths**) – tailored for French oral prep
- 🇬🇧 *MIT OCW – Single Variable & Linear Algebra*
- *Paul's Online Math Notes* (tutorial.math.lamar.edu)
- *Art of Problem Solving* (proof practice, induction, etc.)
- Khan Academy, YouTube: 3Blue1Brown

#### For Computer Science

- *CS50 (Harvard)* – for algorithm foundations
